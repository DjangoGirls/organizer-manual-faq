Yes :)

You have two solutions:

- You could do like this [event website](https://djangogirls.org/bern/) and create two columns: one for each language. When creating your application form, don't forget to write it in both languages.
- We can create another website: you'll have one for each language. We will put a link on the top menu so people can switch easily from one lang to another. From there, you can create two different application forms (one for each website) or only one with both languages. If you choose this solution, [contact us](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org)
