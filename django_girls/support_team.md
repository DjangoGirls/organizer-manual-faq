Django Girls Support Team is a group of people who support local organizers and Awesomeness Ambassador in organizing the local Django Girls events. Support Team maintains Django Girls resources and website, develops sources of income for the Django Girls Foundation, and supports daily operations of the organization.

Support Team's role evolved with time: at the beginning, it was a group of people who shaped the way we put processes in place to support sustainability of Django Girls. Today Support Team makes sure Django Girls community grows and supports Awesomeness Ambassador in their responsibilities.
