We don't provide free swag.
 
The good news is that we created a [workshop box](https://djangogirls.org/workshop-box) that you can order on our store: it's a golden envelope full of stickers, buttons, nametag and golden letter balloons. Since we bought everything in big bulks, it will be cheaper for you to buy the box than to order by yourself: it will save you time and money ;)

We strongly advise you to order it at least 6 weeks before your event: if you don't do it, we can't guarantee it will arrive on time for your workshop. 

We can send you a free workshop box but your event has to meet certain requirements [listed on this page](https://djangogirls.org/workshop-box).
