 If you can, book your venue the evening before the workshop to do an installation party following these [instructions](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/index.html). You can also use this time to invite people from your local Python and Django communities to do lightning talks.
 
If you can't do that, invite your coaches to meet their group online and send them these [instructions](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/index.html). To be sure they have time to plan this online party, contact your coaches at least a week before the event.
