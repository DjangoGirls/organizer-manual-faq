Welcome to our FAQ âœ¨

Django Girls events have been happening all over the world for a while now, and
we get some repeat questions. Hopefully this page will help you if part of the
planning process has you confused!

If you can't find what you're looking for, ask your question in our [organizers' Slack](https://djangogirls.slack.com) or [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/django-girls-organizers). If no one can help you there, [contact the Django Girls Support Team](mailto:hello@djangogirls.org).
