You won't be able to send individual emails through the `messaging panel`.

To contact only one person from your waiting list:

* Change the `Application status` to `Application accepted` and reload the page.
* Copy the email address and send an email using Gmail or your emails client.
* When you have an answer, manually change the `RSVP` to accepted or rejected.
* If the answer was negative, move to the next person in the waiting list and repeat the previous steps.
