Scoring applications is hard! Sometimes when you score, you have a certain percentage of applicants at the top, but then some in the middle who are tied and you can't select the number you need. Our suggestions are: 

- Recruit some more volunteers (maybe former coaches or organizers in other cities) to help you score. More votes lessens the likelihood that you'll have ties. 
- Rescore those applications with your team, to see if a second look at the applicant helps you form a consensus. 
- Accept the applicants who applied first, if there is a tie, and put the rest on a waiting list.
